# SOLID Principles Implementation Report

## Purpose

This report demonstrates the implementation of three SOLID principles in the Contact System application. The SOLID principles are key object-oriented design concepts that promote maintainable, scalable, and flexible software architecture. The three principles implemented in this project are:

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** - Each class should have only one reason to change
2. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)** - High-level modules should depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations
3. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** - Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification

## Implementation

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have only one responsibility and therefore only one reason to change. This principle is demonstrated throughout the codebase by separating concerns into distinct classes.

#### Contact Class
```csharp
public class Contact
{
    public string Name { get; }
    public string Email { get; }
    public string Phone { get; }
    // ...
}
```
**Responsibility:** Represents a contact entity with its properties. This class only changes if the contact data structure needs to change.

#### ContactService Class
```csharp
public class ContactService : IContactService
{
    private readonly IContactRepository _repository;
    private readonly INotificationService _notification;

    public async Task AddContact(Contact contact) { }
    public async Task<IEnumerable<Contact>> GetAllContacts() { }
    public async Task DeleteContact(string name) { }
}
```
**Responsibility:** Handles business logic for contacts (adding, retrieving, deleting, and coordinating notifications). This class only changes if business rules for contact management change.

#### InMemoryContactRepository Class
```csharp
public class InMemoryContactRepository : IContactRepository
{
    private readonly List<Contact> _contacts = new List<Contact>();

    public async Task Add(Contact contact) { }
    public async Task<IEnumerable<Contact>> GetAll() { }
    public async Task Delete(string name) { }
}
```
**Responsibility:** Manages in-memory storage of contacts. This class only changes if the in-memory storage mechanism needs to change.

#### ConsoleNotificationService Class
```csharp
public class ConsoleNotificationService : INotificationService
{
    public Task Notify(string message) { }
}
```
**Responsibility:** Handles notification logic (console output). This class only changes if the notification mechanism needs to change.

Each class has a single, well-defined responsibility, making the code easier to maintain and test.

### 2. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

The Dependency Inversion Principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. This is implemented through the `IContactRepository` and `INotificationService` interfaces.

#### Interface Abstractions
```csharp
public interface IContactRepository
{
    Task Add(Contact contact);
    Task<IEnumerable<Contact>> GetAll();
    Task Delete(string name);
}

public interface INotificationService
{
    Task Notify(string message);
}
```

These interfaces define the contracts for repository and notification implementations, creating abstraction layers between business logic and concrete implementations.

#### High-Level Module (ContactService)
```csharp
public class ContactService : IContactService
{
    private readonly IContactRepository _repository;
    private readonly INotificationService _notification;

    public ContactService(IContactRepository repository, INotificationService notification)
    {
        _repository = repository;
        _notification = notification;
    }
}
```

The `ContactService` class (high-level module) depends on the `IContactRepository` and `INotificationService` abstractions, not on concrete implementations like `InMemoryContactRepository` or `ConsoleNotificationService`. These dependencies are injected through the constructor.

#### Dependency Injection in Program
```csharp
IContactRepository repository = new InMemoryContactRepository();
INotificationService notification = new ConsoleNotificationService();
IContactService contactService = new ContactService(repository, notification);
```

The concrete implementations are chosen at runtime and injected into `ContactService`. The service doesn't know or care about the specific implementations—it only knows the interface contracts.

**Benefits:**
- Easy to swap implementations (in-memory ↔ database storage, console ↔ email notifications)
- Simplified unit testing (can inject mock repositories and notification services)
- Reduced coupling between components

---

### 3. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

The Open/Closed Principle states that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. This principle is demonstrated through the repository and notification patterns with multiple implementations.

#### Closed for Modification
The `ContactService` class is closed for modification when adding new storage or notification mechanisms:

```csharp
public class ContactService : IContactService
{
    private readonly IContactRepository _repository;
    private readonly INotificationService _notification;
    // This code never needs to change when adding new repository or notification types
}
```

#### Open for Extension
New implementations can be added without modifying existing code:

**Existing Repository Implementation:**
```csharp
public class InMemoryContactRepository : IContactRepository
{
    // In-memory storage implementation
}
```

**Future Repository Extensions (examples):**
You could add new repository types without touching `ContactService`:
- `FileContactRepository` - for file-based storage
- `DatabaseContactRepository` - for SQL database storage
- `CloudContactRepository` - for cloud storage

**Existing Notification Implementation:**
```csharp
public class ConsoleNotificationService : INotificationService
{
    // Console notification implementation
}
```

**Future Notification Extensions (examples):**
You could add new notification types without touching `ContactService`:
- `EmailNotificationService` - for email notifications
- `SmsNotificationService` - for SMS notifications
- `LogNotificationService` - for logging notifications

Each new implementation only requires:
1. Creating a new class that implements the appropriate interface
2. Implementing the required methods
3. Injecting the new implementation into `ContactService`

```csharp
// Example: Switching to different implementations requires only changing these lines
IContactRepository repository = new FileContactRepository("contacts.json");
INotificationService notification = new EmailNotificationService();
IContactService contactService = new ContactService(repository, notification);
```

The `ContactService` remains unchanged, demonstrating that it's closed for modification but the system is open for extension through new implementations.

## Conclusion

This Contact System application successfully demonstrates three SOLID principles:

- **SRP**: Each class has a single, well-defined responsibility (entity, business logic, storage, notifications)
- **DIP**: High-level modules depend on abstractions (interfaces) rather than concrete implementations
- **OCP**: The system can be extended with new repository and notification types without modifying existing code

These principles work together to create a flexible, maintainable architecture where components are loosely coupled, easily testable, and adaptable to changing requirements.
